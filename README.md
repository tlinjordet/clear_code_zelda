# clear_code_zelda

Following Pygame tutorial [Creating a Zelda style game in Python [with some Dark Souls elements]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw) from Youtube channel [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearCode).

The intent is to type out all code and code changes manually, anticipating the tutorial's next steps where possible.

## Python environment
Python environment was set up as follows:
```
conda create -n pygame_env python=3.9 conda pip
conda activate pygame_env
python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.0.1
```
